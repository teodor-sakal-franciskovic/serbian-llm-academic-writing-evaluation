# 📘 Academic Writing Evaluation Rules

This document describes the evaluation rules used for assessing academic writing quality.
Each rule defines a clear instruction that must be satisfied in order to achieve a high score.
All of the definitions were originally written in Serbian language (and used like that in LLM prompts).

The rules are divided into:
- Global writing rules (apply to the entire document)
- Chapter-specific rules (apply to individual sections of the paper)

## 🌍 Global Writing Rules

| Rule Name | Rule Description |
|---------|------------------|
| Grammar and Spelling | The text must be grammatically correct and free of spelling errors. |
| Foreign Terms | Foreign words must be written in italics. If a term is translated into Serbian, the original foreign term must be provided in parentheses. |
| Abbreviations | When introducing an abbreviation, the full term must be stated first. Afterwards, only the abbreviation should be used (except in chapter titles). Abbreviations that are never used later are not allowed. |
| Argumentation | All claims must be supported by citations or justified by the results of the work. References must be embedded within the sentence and placed as close as possible to the claim they support. |
| Sentence Conciseness | Each sentence must express one and only one main point. |
| Sentence Clarity | Sentences must be unambiguous, easy to understand, and logically structured, without unnecessary complexity or vague phrasing. |
| Active and Passive Voice | Active voice should be the default. Passive voice should be used only when the agent is irrelevant, obvious, or when the focus is on the result or a general fact. |
| Sentence Opening | Sentences must not begin with conjunctions such as And, Or, or But, nor with numerals. |
| Sentence Content | Sentences must be formal in tone, avoid slang and jargon, and must not address the reader directly. |
| Tense Usage | Present tense is used for stating general facts, while past tense is used when describing the author's own results. |
| Comma Usage | Commas must be used before but and however, must not be used before and or or, are required in enumerations, for separating independent clauses, and are mandatory in appositions. |
| Punctuation | Exclamation marks should be avoided. Em dashes are used for inserted remarks, hyphens for compound words, and semicolons for pauses longer than a comma but shorter than a period. |
| Paragraph Conciseness | Each paragraph should cover one and only one topic. |
| Paragraph Organization | A paragraph must contain a topic sentence, supporting sentences that elaborate the idea, and a concluding sentence that summarizes or links to the next paragraph. |
| Terminological Consistency | The same term or phrase must be used consistently to refer to the same concept throughout the text. |
| Repetition | The text must not be repetitive. Concepts already presented elsewhere should not be repeated. |
| Unnecessary Details | The text must not include unnecessary details that are not essential for understanding the topic. |
| Relevance to the Topic | All content must be clearly related to the topic of the paper. |
| Verbosity | The use of generic or filler words should be avoided. |
| Use of Personal Pronouns | Personal pronouns should be avoided in order to maintain objectivity. |
